This is a C++ Remake of the original Hammafia Extension made by my friend ZF9 in C# (https://github.com/zf9/HamMafia-extension). This was created as Hammafia.co updated and now their menu folder is based off your PC username meaning his version is currently updated and I prefer C++ so I thought I would make a C++ version (terribly coded ofc).
